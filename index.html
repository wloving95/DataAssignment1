  New York city has a gentrification problem. Yes, it has had one for a long time but it seems that nobody has asked the important question. Where are all of these people going? What neighborhoods house the families and people who have been pushed out of recently gentrified? Of course they are only able to go to  the areas they can afford. Neighborhoods which are in turn ripe for gentrification themselves due to low rents, cheap real estate and being places of historical and cultural value.

  Probably the most well-known example of gentrification in recent New York City is Bedford-Stuyvesant. Long before that, the nouveau riche swarmed into areas like Harlem, the Bowery and soon enough lower-income families and people were forced into the outer boroughs, creating longer commutes towards job locations and opportunities, perhaps even raising their costs of living.

However, in recent years the outer boroughs have faced an explosion of gentrification in neighborhoods ranging through all areas of the outer boroughs. Even areas such as Far Rockaway, long a majority Black community, has seen a rise in newcomers with more money paving the way for larger developments that are certain to occur in the future.

  The question remains about what symbiotically beneficial solutions can be proposed and enacted to create a way to rehabilitate these neighborhoods without excluding the citizens that already live there as well as providing a pathway for those residents to grow financially with the neighborhood.  Many ideas have been proposed, such as; abolishing single family zoning laws, the taxation of vacant properties, the creation of housing vouchers for low and middle income residents. Theories that are already in practice in NYC are those such as lotteries for low and middle income residents for rent stabilized apartments in new luxury buildings, however even those only represent a fraction of the actual apartments available in these buildings. For now and for the near future, the only hope that a majority of residents who are at-risk of being displaced to gentrification is the hope that the government actually pays attention to its citizens who need help the most.
